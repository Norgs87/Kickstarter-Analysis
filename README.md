# Kickstarter-Analysis
## Over of the Project
###    Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends was big overview of completing this project
## Purpose
###   The reason for this project was to look at data from other kick starters to help Louise whose play Fever came to close see how different campaigns did in their own kick starters.  Superficially we homed in the data that was concerned with the field of theatre. 
## Analysis and Challenges
###     The amount of data that was collected was vast and this provided an initial challenge.  The size of the data set made maneuvering the data around difficult.  In the case of smaller data sets it is possibly to manipulate the sheet manually and to see how everything works with each other. In this case we had to let Excel take and use this power to the make the data into something that was palatable.  
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
###   The first objective that we were concerned about was the outcomes of the various kick starters with relation to the launch date.  Specifically, we looked at kick starters that were theatre based.  The launch dates were categorized by Months, and we only looked at successful, failed, and canceled kick starters.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
###   The second objective was to look at how the kick starters fared in the relation to what their stated goal was.  By looking at the data it showed that the most successful range for a goal was less than 1000.  The reason that I liked this dataset more the other one was that is calculated percentages of the outcomes based on total amount for each range.

## Challanges and Difficulties Encountered
###   One of the biggest challenges that I encountered was due to the size and navigating through the data.  Especially with the outcomes based on goals deliverable making sure that I was taking data from the right place and manipulating in the right way proved difficult.  When using the Countifs function I kept having trouble making sure that are the parameters to have the correct data be displayed were met. I also was met with difficulty regarding trying to make the dataset smaller.  Since we were only concerned with data from plays, that was the only category that we needed to take the other needed data from, and I missed this doing the second deliverable the first time.  Once I figured out that only data that was concerned with plays was wanted, the rest of the sheet went smoothly.

## Results
-   Based on a quick first initial look at the Theatre outcomes graph it shows that May had the most launched kick starters, May also had the most launched successful kick starters but weirdly enough it didnâ€™t have the most launched failed kick starters, that belongs to October.  In general, according to the data the summer months had the most successfully launched kick starters. One limitation of this data set is that it shows the gross numbers regarding successful, failed, and canceled kick starters, but doesn't show them as percentage of the total kick starters for that month. For example, August had 72 out of 123 for a ~67% percent success rate while November had 54 out of 88 for a success rate of ~61%. 
-   The outcomes based on goals sheet for me showed a better relationship in the data set since showed percentages for each outcome in regards for the total count of that range.  The data showed that the most fulfilled goal was ones under 1000 which makes sense because this is by far the easiest to meet.  
-   What surprised me was that after decreasing the percentage successful for 1000-34999, 350000-44999 ranges increased or stayed the same before freefalling.  The reason for this is also the reason that using percentages isn't always the best.  For the last 6 ranges the most total projects in a certain range was 12 while it bottomed out at 1.  These small of subsets may not show the whole picture and is large limitation with this data set.  Another limitation was it just showed successful or failed without regards to the percentage total raised out of the initial goal.

-   An idea that I think would be good to look would be amount pledged regarding the goal and then look at how the length of time that the Kickstarter ran for.  By looking at the amount pledged vs goal it gives more insights to the failed kick starters and close they may have been and if they went over the goal instead of just a pass/fail designation.
